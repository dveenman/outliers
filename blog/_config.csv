# This is a config file, formatted as CSV (comma separated value)
# Use "" to wrap strings with special characters
# Lines starting with the hash sign are ignored
#
# In projects, you often need to provide user level data for the code
# to run. Examples are user names and passwords to access external 
# data or paths to data that are stored outside of the project's
# directory. You need to inform the users what they are supposed to
# configurate here. A good place to do this is in the README.
#
# Here, we need the user to provide their WRDS access data as our toy
# project used WRDS.
#
# Edit and save the file as 'config.csv'
# PLEASE NOTE: 'config.csv' is included in '.gitignore' so that it is
# not accidentially committed. NEVER commit usernames/passwords or 
# similar sensistive data.
