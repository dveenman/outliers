This small static country-level dataset characterizes 30 countries that, as of Jan 1st, 2021, are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) along three categories:

- Whether they are member of the EEA (true for all 30),
- whether they are member of the European Union (true for 27 but not for Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and
- whether they are member of the Eurozone (true for 19 countries)

Besides these categories the data contains the UN code, the English names as well as the ISO 3166 alpha-2 and alpha-3 country codes to identify the respective countries. All characterizations are as of Jan 1st, 2021 (meaning that the UK is excluded) and are based on authoritative resources:

- https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en
- https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/euro/which-countries-use-euro_en

The data have been compiled by [Joachim Gassen](gassen@hu-berlin.de) in March 2021.
